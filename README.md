Blood Bank Management System
---
Donor Registration: The system allows registration of blood donors, capturing essential details such as name, age, blood type, and contact information. Each donor's last donation date is tracked to ensure adherence to donation intervals.

Recipient Registration: Recipients in need of blood transfusions can be registered with details including name, age, required blood type, urgency level, and contact information. This information helps prioritize and manage transfusion requests effectively.

Blood Bag Management: Upon donation, blood is processed into blood bags, each labeled with donor information, donation date, expiry date, and import timestamp. This ensures traceability and adherence to safety protocols.

Cord Blood Bank: The system includes a module for managing cord blood donations. Cord blood, collected from umbilical cords after childbirth, is stored based on blood type and volume, with detailed tracking of collection and expiry dates.

Thalassemia Ward Management: For patients with thalassemia, the system facilitates admission by recording patient details such as name, age, blood type, and contact information. This supports ongoing care and treatment planning.

Search and Reporting: Healthcare providers can quickly search for donors or recipients based on blood type, ensuring rapid response to urgent transfusion needs. Reports provide insights into inventory levels and donation trends.

User-friendly Interface: The system features a user-friendly interface with a menu-driven navigation system. It allows staff to perform tasks such as donor registration, blood bag addition, and patient admission efficiently.
